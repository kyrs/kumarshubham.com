        <h4 class="project-title"><a href="https://github.com/kyrs/deepdetect/tree/tensorflow/">DeepDetect + Tensorflow</a></h4>
        <p>This was my first open source contribution which ever get merged into master.I have been involved in <a href="http://deepdetect.com/">DeepDetect</a> since summer of 2016 thanks to this project. It involved development of tensorflow based backend for <strong>deepdetect</strong> to run <strong>inception</strong> based models. Which at that time was only present in tensorflow. You can refer to following <a href="https://github.com/beniz/deepdetect/issues/30">issue</a> and <a href="https://github.com/beniz/deepdetect/pull/209">PR</a> for more detail. </p>

        <p> Recently Caffe have integerated a PR for <a href="https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/pull/3948">LSTM</a> based model into their master branch. For past 2 month. I have been involved in this project. you can track the development in following issue. <a href="https://github.com/beniz/deepdetect/issues/140">DeepDetect +lstm</a></p>

        <p>  Consider having Master, PHD, B-tech from all renowned college in india. All in one stage a competing to solve one of the most interesting idea in health care based data science. This is what, research innovation challenge by <strong>XRCI</strong> all about. We competed in that competition and were <strong>runner up</strong> of first round and secured <strong> fifth </strong> position in final round among 3000+ team, participating in the competition. </p>

        <p> <a href="https://e2e.ti.com/group/universityprogram/w/contests/2411.innovation-challenge-india">TIIC IDC</a> is an anuual university level competition organized by Texas Instrument to bring young innovator on a common platform. We participated in this competition with our idea of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbyoTp0O2eM">Sign Language Converter(SLC)</a> A small and portable device for speech impaired people, capable of converting their hand gesture directly into speech format in real time. Interesting thing about SLC is that it doesn't put any constrain on user to wear any sensor embeded glove and make a user friendly experience. We reached till semi-finals and were listed among Top <strong>80</strong> in a competition of 2000+ people.</p>
