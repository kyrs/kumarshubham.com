You can refer to following <a href="https://github.com/beniz/deepdetect/issues/30">issue</a> and <a href="https://github.com/beniz/deepdetect/pull/209">PR</a> for more detail. </p>

Interesting thing about SLC is that it doesn't put any constrain on user to wear any sensor embeded glove and make a user friendly experience. We reached till semi-finals and were listed among Top <strong>80</strong> in a competition of 2000+ people.</p>
